# Spectrum Graph plugin for FM-DX Webserver

This plugin scans the FM radio band in under 1.5 seconds, then displayed in a spectrum window.

## Instructions

* [Download the latest zip file](https://github.com/AmateurAudioDude/FM-DX-Webserver-Plugin-Spectrum-Graph/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Extract `SpectrumGraph` folder, and `SpectrumGraph.js` to **FM-DX Webserver** `plugins` folder
* Restart **FM-DX Webserver** if required
* Login to **Adminstrator Panel** and enable plugin
* Restart **FM-DX Webserver** again if required
* Server-side configuration options stored in `/plugins_configs/SpectrumGraph.json`
* Client-side configuration options located in `pluginSpectrumGraph.js`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For full compatibility, **TEF668X radio** requires **TEF6686_ESP32 v2.20** or newer firmware, available from the FMDX.org Discord server, [PE5PVB's GitHub](https://github.com/PE5PVB/TEF6686_ESP32), or alternatively, download my latest personal fork [here](https://github.com/AmateurAudioDude/TEF6686_ESP32/releases). It is strongly recommended that TEF radios with older firmware be updated for optimal performance.

## SpectrumGraph.json
 
- **`rescanDelay`**: Number of seconds elapsed since the previous scan before a new scan can be initiated.   
- **`tuningRange`**: Side frequencies to scan, in MHz. A value of 0 scans the entire FM/OIRT band.   
- **`tuningStepSize`**: Tuning step size, in kHz. Recommended values are either 100 or 50.   
- **`tuningBandwidth`**: Supported bandwidth values are 0, 56, 64, 72, 84, 97, 114, 133, 151, 168, 184, 200, 217, 236, 254, 287, and 311.   
- **`fmLowerLimit`**: Lower end of the FM band to scan. Default value is 86.   
- **`customRanges`**: Configure up to two custom frequency range buttons. Example configuration: `"2, FM1, 65, 74, FM2, 80, 88",`   
- **`warnIncompleteData`**: Enable to display console warnings about incomplete/interrupted scans. Note: Some firmware outputs data that always appears to be incomplete.
- **`logLocalCommands`**: Disable to hide commands shown in console that have been sent locally, such as from another plugin.   

> [!TIP]
> The granular control by **`tuningStepSize`** allows the graph's step size to be adjusted from 100 kHz to 50 kHz, enabling more precise RF signal analysis. This will, however, increase the time it takes to perform a scan.

> [!CAUTION]
> Lowering the value of **`rescanDelay`** increases the risk of your server being overloaded with scan requests.
